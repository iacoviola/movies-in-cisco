# Movies In Cisco

Movies In Cisco allows you to visualize on a map all the movies which have ever been filmed in the beautiful city of San Francisco.

## How the app works

### STEP ONE
The entire app is based on an Open Data set made available by the city of San Francisco whose link is the following:

https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am

Starting from this data set which contains, amongst other informations, the location in which a scene of a certain movie was filmed.
The location is not indicated as coordinates but just as an address.

### STEP TWO
This forced me to convert every address for every entry in the data set to coordinates, using Google's geocoding API:

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview

The problem with this particular API is that it is restricted to a maximum number of requests per second (50), so i had to configure multiple threads fetch data quickly but looking out for a potential query limit error generated by the web-service, *the problem still needs to be solved but with an average speed connection it shouldn't occur*

### STEP THREE
The converted locations are then saved in a local database, to get around the conversion effort, and shown on the map as clusters, for performance related reasons.

Once a user zooms in the clusters divide in smaller clusters eventually revealing a marker which can be clicked and shows the movie and the poster for the corresponding movie.

If multiple movies where filmed in the same location a cluster will be available to click generating a popup window showing all the different movies.

### STEP FOUR
The application is able to load posters for most of the movies thanks to the TMDB API:

https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Given the name of a movie the web-service replies with a set of information about it, including the path of the poster on the database, which can then be retrieved and loaded on the app thanks to the Glide framework.
*This part of the app is a bit rusty since I couldn't put the request function in a separate thread resulting in the UI locking sometimes until the request is completed*
